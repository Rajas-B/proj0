# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
There are 4 pages in my project0, all of which are linked to each other by a navigation bar. The navigation bar is responsive to size of the browser. The navigation bar also highlights the active tab.
On the Home page, there is a form for typing personal information which is designed using CSS elements that I wrote as well as using Bootstrap classes.
On the Bootstrap page, I have used bootstrap dividing the page according to the size of the pictures that are diplayed. The size of the images are also responsive to the width of the web broswer. There's a checklist below to serve as an example of SCSS variable and inheritance.
On the List page, there are just 2 lists; one ordered and an unordered list.
There is a table designed using Bootstrap filled with random data on the Table page.
